I wanted to learn about how to make a .wav file in java. 
I watched a guy make it in C and thought I could basically do the same thing in Java, since I am more familiar with it.

I followed a tutorial that was in C++ since it went into more indepth then a C video I watched. It covered a lot more interesting things.
This is why I used int main(){}. I know its not normal for Java and should be changed but idc all that much. I thought it would be more fun to do it a different way!

so yea :D
